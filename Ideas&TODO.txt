	#    To do    #
	###############

	- PathFolderDialogMethod throws an exception if you have no permission to acess file or folder
		we have to find a better solution
	- Add Views + ViewModels for Settings
	- search Code for unnecessary things
	- Templates for texmaker
	- Command Interface or whatever Pattern to Access MainView (bothersome to always make a new Object of mainwindow
		also not really mvvm like
	- Data extractor of the templates for .tex files
	- add a whitelist
	- add a extension filter
	- A textbox where you can define the language which is written to \lstinputlisting[language=C] (by Fx)
	
	###############
	#    Ideas    #
	###############

	- Extension depending texcode
	- syntaxhighlighting
	- Parameters in source file header (project name, language, author, date, ... )
		sample: 
		/*
		project= Testproject
		language= C++
		autor= Fx
		date= 21.11.2016
		*/
	- Maybe i can get the sorted list from Itemsource of the GridView when it was sorted by the gridview?

	###############
	#    Done     #
	###############
	
	- Modern UI
	- Data Grid and not listview
	- MVVM Pattern
	- Update for .gitignore to exclude unnecessary debug files
	- Basic folder and subfolder search
	- Databinding on gridview
